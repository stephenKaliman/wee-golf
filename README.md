2. Run `host.bat` if you are on Windows, or `host.command` if you are on Mac
3. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser

# Special Features
1. Bump-Mapped terrain
2. Physics (gravity, friction)
3. Collision detection (intersection between golf ball trajectory and hills/ground/hole)

# Planned additions
1. More terrain (trees, sand, etc)
2. More advanced physics (improved friction, rolling momentum & inertia)
3. Improved animations (spinning ball, camera -> ball -> hole tracking)
